CHANGE LOG FILE for wpupudate by Ammon Shepherd <ammon.shepherd@gmail.com>

FORMAT
VERSION  DATE (YYYY-MM-DD)  NAME (if none, it's Ammon)

1.6.6  2011-12-21
	* Added "--single-transaction" to the mysqldump command to avoid crashing
	when dumping a database with a large number of tables.

1.6.5  2011-07-01
	* Added usage of functions for some repetitive tasks.
	* Added -c flag to use the wp-config.php for the database user and
	password instead of prompting for one.
	* Changed the behavior for backing up the wp-content folder. Now it
	creates a zip file of the wp-content folder to save space, adding only
	updated files since the zip file was last made. 
	* Mysql dump is now zipped to save space.
	* Added security check for wp-content/uploads/.htaccess and create it if 
	not there.
	* Changed some spacing here and there.
	* Added quotes around the sqlpass variable to allow for passwords with
	punctuation marks (specifically the semicolon which kills mysql calls).

1.6.4  2011-01-08  
    * Add steps to secure WordPress, and switch to turn off.

1.6.3  2010-12-03  
	* Added the -d flag to supply the database name when the command is run.
	Works best if used when updating a single WP install.

1.6.2  2010-12-01
	* Fixed an issue with unbound variable for homeurl when not found in
	database. 

1.6.1 
    * Added option to skip the backups

1.6  2010-07-23
	* Added check for SVN repository. If the current repository is not the
	same as the default, prompt user for which repo to use.
	* Changed script to use the owner of the wp-content folder instead of the
	.svn folder. All permissions changes use the owner of the wp-content
	folder instead of the .svn folder
	* Added a few checks for using sudo and running command in in non-sudo if
	that option is used.
    * Added some comments into the script
    * Added some color to the output.
    * Added an option that just outputs the default repo used
	* Added a check for the 'home' field in the WP database, and to use the
	'siteurl' field instead if the 'home' is empty. This is the URL to use for
	updating the database after upgrading.

1.5.5  2010-03-09
    * changed the SVN repository to the new URL
	* Added the set commands to end the script correctly if an unset variable
	is found or a statement returns non-true.

1.5.5  2010-01-07
	* add an option to skip the fixing of permissions and owner and an option
	to not use sudo

1.5.4  2009-07-14
	* store svn reports in a wpupdate-reports folder. Checks if exists. If not
	then creates it as a subdirectory of REPORTSPATH.

1.5.3  2009-06-25
	* fixed the way to get the tb_prefix variable. If the wp-config.php file
	was created before version 2.1 of WP then the script did not get the table
	prefix corrrectly.
    * updated a few script prompts

1.5.2  2009-03-19
	* Added check for the size of wp-content. If larger than 100MB, it won't
	backup the directory.
	* Changed the sed call to get the table prefix to check for single ( ' )
	and double ( " ) quotes. There were two variables checking for this, so
	changed code to use the first one only.
	* Removed the comment out section about old way to ask for files.
	* Fixed conditional statement checking for value in url variable. Also
	made a check to only run the update script if the url variable starts with
	'http', otherwise it just reminds you to run it.
                       
1.5.1  2009-01-27
	* Fixed the ability to use -i, just a directory, and changed default
	behavior to update current directory if no -f or -i flag given.

1.5  2008-12-11
    * Converted script to use command line flags (options)

1.4  2008-12-01
	* Changed default behavior to use the svn branches instead of tags 

1.3  2008-07-30
	* Added a line that prints out any svn errors. And made a check to see if
	the url variable has a value. Don't run curl unless it does.

1.2  2008-07-18
	* Script will now run the DB upgrade.php script using curl. Pulls the info
	from the database for that install. 

1.1  2008-04-29
	* Changed the line for option 'd' in the first prompt to use the FILENAME
	variable.

1.0  2008-03-31
	* Changed the way permissions are done. Only files/folders starting  with
	"wp-" should be altered. Added a "/" in the "Don't forget to run..." line.
	Changed the prompt asking for the file containing svn installs. Allows for
	a default location hard coded into the program with the FILENAME variable.  

0.9  2008-02-26
	* Added ability to have comments in the FILENAME file.  Commented lines
	begin with a semi-colon ";". Edited the HELPTEXT.  

0.8  2008-01-03
	* Figured out the HELPTEXT variable stuff and updated the text.  
	* Moved the code that asks for the file location and creates the array to
	be within the if...else... logic so --help works, and if no version is
	given, the help text is displayed.  


0.7  2007-09-04
	* Fixed some minor text by adding ellipses at the end of text. Added a
	constant for where to save the svn reports.
