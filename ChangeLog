                           Change log

 v0.7      09.04.07 - Fixed some minor text by adding ellipses at the end of
                       text. Added a constant for where to save the svn
                       reports.  

 v0.8      01.03.08 - Figured out the HELPTEXT variable stuff and updated the
                       text.  
                    - Moved the code that asks for the file location and
                       creates the array to be within the if...else... logic
                       so --help works, and if no version is given, the help
                       text is displayed.  

 v0.9      02.26.08 - Added ability to have comments in the FILENAME file.
                       Commented lines begin with a semi-colon ";". Edited the
                       HELPTEXT.  

 v1.0      03.31.08 - Changed the way permissions are done. Only files/folders
                       starting  with "wp-" should be altered. Added a "/" in
                       the "Don't forget to run..." line.  Changed the prompt
                       asking for the file containing svn installs. Allows for
                       a default location hard coded into the program with the
                       FILENAME variable.  
 v1.1      04.29.08 - Changed the
                       line for option 'd' in the first prompt to use the
                       FILENAME variable.

 v1.2      07.18.08 - Script will now run the DB upgrade.php script using
                       curl. Pulls the info from the database for that
                       install. 

 v1.3      07.30.08 - Added a line that prints out any svn errors. And made a
                       check to see if the url variable has a value. Don't run
                       curl unless it does.

 v1.4      12.01.08 - Changed default behavior to use the svn branches instead
                       of tags 

 v1.5      12.11.08 - Converted script to use command line flags (options)
                       
 v1.5.1    01.27.09 - Fixed the ability to use -i, just a directory, and 
                       changed default behavior to update current directory if
                       no -f or -i flag given.
 v1.5.2    03.19.09 - Added check for the size of wp-content. If larger than
                       100MB, it won't backup the directory.
                    - Changed the sed call to get the table prefix to check for
                       single ( ' ) and double ( " ) quotes. There were two
                       variables checking for this, so changed code to use the
                       first one only.
                    - Removed the comment out section about old way to ask for
                       files.
                    - Fixed conditional statement checking for value in url
                       variable. Also made a check to only run the update
                       script if the url variable starts with 'http', otherwise
                       it just reminds you to run it.
 v1.5.3    06.25.09 - fixed the way to get the tb_prefix variable. If the
                       wp-config.php file was created before version 2.1 of WP
                       then the script did not get the table prefix corrrectly.
                    - updated a few script prompts
 v1.5.4    07.14.09 - store svn reports in a wpupdate-reports folder. Checks if
                       exists. If not then creates it as a subdirectory of 
                       REPORTSPATH.
 v1.5.5    01.07.10 - add an option to skip the fixing of permissions and owner
                       and an option to not use sudo
 v1.5.5    03.09.10 - changed the SVN repository to the new URL
                    - Added the set commands to end the script correctly if an
                       unset variable is found or a statement returns non-true.
 v1.6      07.23.10 - Added check for SVN repository. If the current repository
                       is not the same as the default, prompt user for which
                       repo to use.
                    - Changed script to use the owner of the wp-content folder
                       instead of the .svn folder. All permissions changes use
                       the owner of the wp-content folder instead of the .svn 
                       folder
                    - Added a few checks for using sudo and running command in
                       in non-sudo if that option is used.
                    - Added some comments into the script
                    - Added some color to the output.
                    - Added an option that just outputs the default repo used
                    - Added a check for the 'home' field in the WP database, 
                       and to use the 'siteurl' field instead if the 'home' is
                       empty. This is the URL to use for updating the database
                       after upgrading.
 v1.6.1             - Added option to skip the backups
 v1.6.2    12.01.10 - Fixed an issue with unbound variable for homeurl when not
                       found in database. 
 v1.6.3    12.03.10 - Added the -d flag to supply the database name when the 
                       command is run. Works best if used when updating a
                       single WP install.
 v1.6.4    01.18.11 - Add steps to secure WordPress, and switch to turn off.
