Usage: wpupdate [OPTIONS]... [WP VERSION NUMBER]
Switch or update the WordPress install(s) to the WP VERSION NUMBER.

Example: wpupdate -buf /home/wp-versions 2.7
This would update all of the installs listed in wp-versions to the 2.7 branch.

"wpupdate -h" for help



OPTIONS:
 -b     use the branches, can not be used with -t (tags) option

 -d     supply the database name to use. Use only when updating a single install

 -f     path to a file containing a list of paths to WordPress installs, can
        not be used with -i (single install) option. File must consist of full
        paths in the form "/wwwroot/sites/mossiso.com/blog/" each on a separate
        line. A ";" semi-colon designates a commented line.  

 -h     display this help info

 -i     path to  a single svn install, can not be used with -f (versions file)
        option 

 -k     skip backing up the wp-content folder and database

 -n     run as a normal user, do not use sudo

 -o     path to output file containing report of svn update. File will be
        created if it does not exist. The directories must already exist. The
        default is to save it to your home directory (ex. /home/bob/)

 -p     turn off the steps to secure and protect WP. Steps include removing
        the install.php file, adding rules to the htaccess file to protect
        the wp-config.php file, the .svn directories, and the wp-content/uploads 
        directory. These steps are done by default.

 -v     outputs version information and exits

 -r     output the default SVN repo used and exit

 -s     svn URL to use for updates (defaults to http://core.svn.wordpress.org/)

 -u     use "svn update", can not be used with -w (switch) option

 -w     use "svn switch", can not be used with -u (update) option 

 -t     use the tags, can not be used with -b (branches) option

 -x     skip fixing permissions and owners


WHAT IT DOES:
    First the wpupudate program makes a backup copy of the MySQL database and
    the wp-contents/ directory. It places these backups in the WP install
    directory.
    
    A WordPress version must be specified. By default the WordPress installs
    are upgraded to the specified branch install. If the -t (tags) option is
    used, the installs will be updated to the specified tag version. If the -w
    (switch) option is used, then the installs are switched to the branch (by
    default) or tag (with -t option) version specified.

THINGS TO KNOW:
    By default the program runs as sudo. To run as normal user, pass the -n
    flag.  This user must have absolute privileges over all files in the
    WordPress folders.

    If the -f or -i flags are not given on the command line, the program will
    attempt to update the current directory.

    You will be prompted for a MySQL user and pass that must have access to all
    of the databases (ex. MySQL root or admin account). Unless the -n flag is
    passed you will be prompted for your user password to enable sudo.
